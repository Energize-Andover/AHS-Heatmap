# Floor Plan Coloring
Made By: Daniel Ivanovich

This program colors the various rooms of Andover High School (AHS) based off of their temperature. The program is being written in a way that, when complete, it *should*  work on **most** floor plans, as long as they meet the following requirements:

1. It is ans SVG file, with "selectable" text (you are able to highlight the text with your mouse)
2. The walls are black
3. The room numbers are not black
4. The room numbers are contained inside the walls

Here is an example of a properly formatted floor plan:

If the floor plan doesn't load, it's hosted [here](https://i.imgur.com/Mt1kolY.png)

If this functionality is implemented, temperature data should be inputted from a CSV file.

### Dependencies
If you want to run this script on your server (or something along those lines), it requires the following:
* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) (installed and added to the PATH)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Pdfminer.six](https://pypi.org/project/pdfminer.six/)
* [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/)
* [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Setup

To run this program on your computer, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a venv (virtual environment) in the root directory and download/install all the dependencies.
3. Create a secret key (just a bunch of random letters, numbers, and symbols), and save it at `data/secret_key.txt`. **Keep this secret key hidden!!!!!*** Most of the operations that Ajax and Flask do use this secret key as a parameter, so think of it like an admin password - if somebody gets it, they can run everything they want, whenever they want, which could break the server and force you to reboot.
4. Run `app.py`, and go to the link that it gives you. That's it! You're done!
